          <p className="ein">Hi, I'm Suzana, and I am looking for a remote job as a Web Developer.

For over a year I've been learning software development in the Digital Career Institute, Berlin. So far, I've completed my one-year training as a Full Stack Web Developer.
At the end of my one-year training, I presented a final project called "Discofy Music App" (which you can check out hier ' https://discofy-music-app.herokuapp.com/ '). I worked alongside one colleague on this project, and we had six weeks to complete it. It included project planning, coding and presentation preparation. The coding itself took 3 weeks.

I've always been interested in software development and I feel thrilled to have finally been able to learn and work in this field this past year. I'm excited by the many different opportunities and choices that this career provides. I'm most attracted to the idea of being able to consistently learn and grow, both as a developer and a person, and continually refine my grasp of the present and up-and-coming technologies. I would like to be given the opportunity to show who I am as a person - hard-working, positive and cooperative.

Career-wise, front-end development is what interests me the most, although back-end development is something that I'm skilled in as well.

I'm looking forward to your feedback and hope to get hired soon.

Stay healthy,

S.J.</p>
